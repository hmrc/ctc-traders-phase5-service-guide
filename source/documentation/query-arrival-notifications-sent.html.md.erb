# Query arrival notifications sent

There are several GET endpoints for querying arrival notifications sent:

- Use [Get all cached arrivals](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/getAllCachedArrivals) to get all arrivals that have been updated within the past 60 days. You can filter for departure declarations updated after a specific date and time and/or submitted with a specified EORI. Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.
- Use [Get a cached arrival for an arrival ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/getCachedArrivalForArrivalID) to get a specific arrival notification sent to the customs office of destination within the past 60 days. Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.
- Use [Get all cached messages related to an arrival](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/getAllCachedMessagesRelatedToArrival) to get all messages related to a specific arrival that have been received within the past 60 days. You can filter for arrivals received after a specific date and time. Movements older than 60 days are archived, so any messages related to them cannot be returned by the API.
- Use [Get a cached message related to an arrival and message ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/getCachedMessageRelatedToArrivalAndMessageID) to get all messages related to a specific arrival and message ID that have been received within the past 60 days. For example, this could include messages about route diversions or unloading permissions. Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.

You can view a transit movement only if your EORI number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement. Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.
