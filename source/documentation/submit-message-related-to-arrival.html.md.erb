# Submit message related to an arrival

Use the POST endpoint [Send a message related to an arrival](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/postMessageRelatedToArrival) to send a message to the customs office of destination about an arrival.

For example, if you are a trader at destination, you will send an 'Unloading Remarks' E_ULD_REM (IE044) message to the office of destination indicating that unloading of the goods has been completed.

If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response will contain a URI and a message ID related to the arrival, which you can use to get the message status.

If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 5MB - this limit will later increase to 8MB), a successful response will include:

- a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
- a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

To submit a message related to an arrival, you must have an EORI number. For more information about entering message sender and recipient details, see [Message sender and recipient guidelines](developer-setup.html#message-sender-and-recipient-guidelines).
