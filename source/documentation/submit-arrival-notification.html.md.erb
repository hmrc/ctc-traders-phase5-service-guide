# Submit arrival notification

Use the POST endpoint [Send an arrival notification message](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/postArrivalNotificationMessage) to notify the customs office of destination that a transit movement has arrived at its final destination.

This request is also called an 'Arrival Notification' E_ARR_NOT (IE007) message.

If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response:

- will contain a URI that you can use to get the message status
- can also include an optional box ID, which you can use to match this movement to any messages received from our [Push Pull Notifications API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/push-pull-notifications-api/1.0)

If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 5MB - this limit will later increase to 8MB), a successful response will include:

- a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
- a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

To submit an arrival notification, you must have an EORI number.
