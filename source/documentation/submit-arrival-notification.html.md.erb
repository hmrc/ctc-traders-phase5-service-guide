# Submit arrival notification

Use the POST endpoint [Send an arrival notification message](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/postArrivalNotificationMessage) to notify the customs office of destination that a transit movement has arrived at its final destination.

This request is also called an 'Arrival Notification' E_ARR_NOT (IE007) message. A successful response will contain a URI that you can use to get the message status. A successful response can also include an optional box ID, which you can use to match this movement to any messages received from the Push Pull Notifications API.

To submit an arrival notification, you must have an EORI number.
