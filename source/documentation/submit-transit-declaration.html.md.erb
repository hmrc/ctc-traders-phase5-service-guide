# Submit transit declaration

Use the POST endpoint [Send a declaration data message](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/postDeclarationDataMessage) to send a transit declaration to the customs office of departure to notify it that you wish to carry out a transit operation.

This request is also called an 'Declaration Data' E_DEC_DAT (IE015) message.

If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response:

- will contain a URI, which you can use to get the message status
- can also include an optional box ID, which you can use to match this movement to any messages received from our [Push Pull Notifications API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/push-pull-notifications-api/1.0)

If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 5MB - this limit will later increase to 8MB), a successful response will include:

- a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
- a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

To submit a transit declaration, you must have an EORI number.
