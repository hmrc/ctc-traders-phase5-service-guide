#Get notifications

You can use the GET endpoint [Get a list of notifications](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/push-pull-notifications-api/1.0/oas/page) of our Push Pull Notifications API to get a copy of the push notifications sent to a given box ID using the PPNS.

***Configuring Push Notification URLs for CTC Traders API (2.1)***

From 21st January 2025, CTC Traders API version 2.1 will be live. Developers using the Push-Pull Notification Service (PPNS) must configure a valid callback URL to receive push notifications for trade movements created in version 2.1.

**Key Points:**

1. Push Notifications Only: This configuration applies only to push notifications.
2. Existing Movements in 2.0: Notifications for trade movements created in version 2.0 will continue to use the 2.0 callback URL while it remains live.
3. Deprecation of 2.0: Version 2.0 will be deprecated shortly after 21st January 2025. Ensure version 2.1 is configured to avoid service disruptions.

**Configuration Steps**:
- Go to Developer Hub > Applications.
- Select your application.
- Open Subscription Configuration.
- Under CTC Traders 2.1 Beta, configure your notification URL.

**Important Note:**
You may still need to receive notifications for version 2.0 after version 2.1 goes live, especially for any existing trade movements. One option is to configure your system to receive notifications for both 2.0 and 2.1 by using the same callback URL for both versions. Alternatively, you can choose to set up separate callback URLs for each version.
