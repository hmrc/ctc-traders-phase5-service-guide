# Query declarations sent

There are several GET endpoints for querying transit declarations sent:

- Use [Get all cached departures](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/getAllCachedDepartures) to get all departure declarations sent to the customs office of departure within the past 60 days. You can filter for departure declarations updated after a specific date and time and/or submitted with a specified EORI. Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API. A successful response will include a Movement Reference Number (MRN) only after it has been allocated to a movement.
- Use [Get a cached departure for a departure ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/getCachedDepartureForDepartureID) to get a specific departure declaration sent to the customs office of departure within the past 60 days. Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API. A successful response will include a Movement Reference Number (MRN) only after it has been allocated to a movement.
- Use [Get all cached messages related to a departure](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/getAllCachedMessagesRelatedToDeparture) to get all messages related to a specific departure declaration sent to the customs office of departure within the past 60 days. You can filter for departure declarations received after a specific date and time. Movements older than 60 days are archived, so any messages related to them cannot be returned by the API. A successful response will include a Movement Reference Number (MRN) only after it has been allocated to a movement.
- Use [Get a cached message related to a departure and message ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.1/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/getCachedMessageRelatedToDepartureAndMessageID) to get all messages related to a specific departure and message ID that have been received within the past 60 days. For example, this could include ‘Declaration rejected’ or Movement Reference Number (MRN) allocated messages. Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.

You can view a transit movement only if your EORI number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement. Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.
