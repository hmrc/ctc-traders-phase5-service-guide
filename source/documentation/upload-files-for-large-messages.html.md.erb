# Upload files for large messages

On a per-message basis, you can choose between sending a message to the NCTS by the small message route or by the large message route.

## Submitting a message as a file 

Using the large message route means submitting a message as a file. The following endpoints support submitting a message as a file to the NCTS:

- [Send a declaration data message](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/postDeclarationDataMessage)
- [Send a message related to a departure](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/postMessageRelatedToDeparture)
- [Send an arrival notification message](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/postArrivalNotificationMessage)
- [Send a message related to an arrival](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/postMessageRelatedToArrival)

The process of uploading a message is the same for all of the endpoints listed.

To upload a file:

1. Send a POST request with an empty body and no `Content-Type`. The API will recognise that you want to upload a file.
2. The API will respond with a JSON body that contains an `uploadDetails` object with two fields:
	-  `href` as a string
	-   `fields` as a set of key-value pairs
3. With a `Content-Type` of `multipart/form-data`, send a POST request to the URL returned in the `href` field with the following payload:
	- each key-value pair in the `fields` object is its own part, with the name of the part named after the key, and the body of the part containing the value
	- the content of the file added as the **last** part of the multipart payload, with a `name` of `file` and `Content-Type` of `application/xml`
4. Await a push notification from our [Push-Pull-Notification Service](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/push-pull-notifications-api/1.0) (PPNS) that will inform you whether your submission succeeded or if errors occurred while processing your message.

An example Python script that submits an IE015 by the large message route is available in this [zip file](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-service-guide/downloads/CTC_Traders_API_v2.0_Large_Message_Upload_Python_Example.zip) on GitHub.

After the file is submitted, any HTTP 2XX status code will indicate a successful upload.

## Tracking progress of messages submitted as files

You can check the progress of the processing status of any message. A submitted message has five possible statuses.

| Status | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| Pending | The CTC Traders API is waiting for the file to process. It has not yet been submitted or it is awaiting a virus check. |
| Processing | The API has received the file and is processing it. |
| Success | The API processed the message successfully. |
| Failed | The API failed to process the message. |
| Received | This is a message that has been received by HMRC and is intended for a trader. (Although this status is possible, it is not likely to be returned.) |

You can use the following endpoints to get the status of messages submitted to the NCTS:

- [Get all cached messages related to a departure](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/getAllCachedMessagesRelatedToDeparture)
- [Get a cached message related to a departure and message ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/getCachedMessageRelatedToDepartureAndMessageID)
- [Get all cached messages related to an arrival](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/getAllCachedMessagesRelatedToArrival)
- [Get a cached message related to an arrival and message ID](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Arrivals/operation/getCachedMessageRelatedToArrivalAndMessageID)

## Push notifications for submitted messages submitted as files

A message submitted by the large message route will receive a push notification of type `SUBMISSION_NOTIFICATION` when it transitions into the `Success` or `Failed` status. If the message failed to send, the error message returned will be identical to that of the small message route.

```json
{
   "messageUri":
"/customs/transits/movements/departures/6482f76c21a8596e/messages/6482f76c564b0f5f",
   "notificationType": "SUBMISSION_NOTIFICATION",
   "response": {
     "message": "LRN large-test-47-XI-3 has previously been used and cannot be reused",
     "code": "CONFLICT"
   }
}
```

For more information about how to receive push notifications, see [Push-pull notiifcations](documentation/developer-setup.html#push-pull-notifications).
