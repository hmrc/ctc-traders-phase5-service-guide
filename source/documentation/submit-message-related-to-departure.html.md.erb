# Submit message related to a departure

Use the POST endpoint [Send a message related to a departure](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/postMessageRelatedToDeparture) to send a message to the customs office of departure about a departure.

For example, if you want to cancel a 'Declaration Data' E_DEC_DAT (IE015) message, you must send a 'Declaration Invalidation Request' E_DEC_INV (IE014) message to the office of departure. A successful response will contain a URI and a message ID related to the departure that you can use to get the message status.

To submit a message related to a departure, you must have an EORI number.
