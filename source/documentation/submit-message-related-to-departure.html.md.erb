# Submit message related to a departure

Use the POST endpoint [Send a message related to a departure](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0/oas/page#tag/Departures/operation/postMessageRelatedToDeparture) to send a message to the customs office of departure about a departure.

For example, if you want to cancel a 'Declaration Data' E_DEC_DAT (IE015) message, you must send a 'Declaration Invalidation Request' E_DEC_INV (IE014) message to the office of departure.

If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB in size), a successful response will contain a URI and a message ID related to the departure that you can use to get the message status.

If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB in size), a successful response will include:

- a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
- a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

To submit a message related to a departure, you must have an EORI number. For more information about entering message sender and recipient details, see [Message sender and recipient guidelines](developer-setup.html#message-sender-and-recipient-guidelines).
